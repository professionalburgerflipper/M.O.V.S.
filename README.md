MULTIPLE OSCILLATOR VIRTUAL SYNTHESISER

A school project made by me for a design class. Made in C++ with the JUCE framework.

This synth features:
- Polyphonic Rendering.
- 2 Independant Oscillators (Each featuring: Wavetypes, Gain, Pitch, and FM Controls).
- Filters with Low, Band and High pass, along with Cutoff and Resonance.
- Filter Low Frequency Oscillation, and ADSR.
- Envelope ADSR.
- Standalone and VST3 support.

More updates on the way if I have the motivation, and please notify me if any bugs are found.

If you would like to use or modify this code, feel free. The JUCER file is provided, you can open it with PROJUCER (Avaliable at https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE)
